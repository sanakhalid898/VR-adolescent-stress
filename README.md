# VR-adolescent-stress
This study explores the potential of a nature-based VR environment as a self-administered tool to support adolescent mental health. By assessing feasibility, engagement, and its impact on stress and mood, the project aims to advance scalable interventions addressing the rising mental health challenges among adolescents.
## Project Overview

### Background
Adolescent mental health is a national mental health emergency amid surging rates of anxiety and depression. Given the scarcity and lack of scalable mental health services, the use of self-administered, evidence-based technologies to support adolescent mental health is both timely and imperative.

### Objective
The goal of this study was twofold:
1. To determine the feasibility, usability, and engagement of a participatory designed, nature-based virtual reality (VR) environment.
2. To determine the preliminary outcomes of our self-administered VR environment on depression, mindfulness, perceived stress, and momentary stress and mood.

### Methods
We conducted a within-person, 3-week, in-home study with a community-based sample of 44 adolescents. Participants completed surveys of perceived stress, depression, cognitive fusion, and mindfulness at intake, postintervention, and a 3-week follow-up. Participants were invited to use a nature-based VR environment that included 6 evidence-based activities 3 to 5 times per week. 

Participants completed momentary stress and mood surveys 5 times each day and before and after each VR session. Postintervention, participants completed surveys on system and intervention usability and their experiences with using the VR system. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and mixed-effects modeling to explore the effect of the VR environment on stress. Qualitative data were analyzed using collaborative thematic analysis.

### Current Focus
At the current stage of the study, we are focusing on mapping timestamps for every respondent's in-game behavior patterns to analyze them with other collected data, which includes:
- Survey responses.
- Categorized in-game behaviors for respondents as qualitative data.

This involves:
- Monitoring participant interaction patterns within the VR environment.
- Mapping timestamps of specific in-game behaviors to survey data to explore correlations.
- Exploring engagement metrics such as session duration, activity completion rates, and frequency of use.
- Using qualitative data to categorize behaviors and derive insights into stress and mood patterns.

### Results (previous phase)
- Participantsâ€™ use of the VR environment ranged from 1 session to 24 sessions (mean 6.27 sessions) at home over a 3-week period. All 44 participants completed the study protocols, indicating the protocol was feasible and the VR environment was engaging for most.
- Both the VR system and intervention received strong usability ratings (mean 74.87 on the System Usability Scale).
- Most teens indicated that the tool was easily administered, relaxing, and helpful with stress. For some, it provided space to process difficult emotions.
- Themes of calm, regulating, and forgetting about everything emerged from open-ended exit interview data.
- The VR intervention significantly reduced momentary stress (pre-intervention: 37.9, post-intervention: 20.6, P=.001) and positively affected mood (pre-intervention: 10.8, post-intervention: 12.0, P=.001).
- The reduction in within-day momentary stress strengthened with increased VR use over time (P=.03).

## Tools and Technologies

- **SQL**: For building the ETL pipeline.
- **Python**: For data preprocessing and feature extraction. Also used for statistical modelling.
- **Tableau**: For data visualization.
- **Mixed-effects modeling**: To analyze high-dimensional EMA and VR-intervention data.
